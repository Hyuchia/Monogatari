/**
 * A component represents an object or content in the game such as screens, menus
 * and all other visual or structural elements.
 *
 * The life cycle of an component follows the Mounting cycle for actions.
 *
 * The mounting cycle has 3 steps:
 *
 * 1. Setup - Here the action needs to set up everything it will need for working
 *            generally, in this section a component will generally add its HTML
 *            content to the global Monogatari object and will set up any needed
 *            configuration or state variables.
 *
 * 2. Bind - Once the component has been setup, its time to bind all the necessary
 *           event listeners or perfom more operations on the DOM once all elements
 *           have been setup. Components will generally bind all the listeners needed
 *           for their inner elements to work correctly.
 *
 * 3. Init - Finally, once the component was setup and it performed all the needed
 *           bindings, it may start performing its operations and perform all
 *          further needed operations.
